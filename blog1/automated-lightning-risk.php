              <p> 1. Lightning discharges are of very high energy and can have devastating effects depending on the path of its discharge. Lightning strike is not predictable and is a random phenomenon both from the aspect of its occurrence and intensity or the energy discharge. </p>
              <p> 2.Assessing the risk caused by lightning is a complex process because the likelihood that your facility will be facing a lightning strike depends on several factors. </p>
              <p> 3.In addition, we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives, historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures, and whatnot! There is a high possibility that the electrical/electronic equipment inside these buildings/structures might also be at risk. The only way to find that out, to do a LIGHTNING RISK ASSESSMENT for your building/structure!For any household or business structure, use our free lightning risk assessment calculator.The lightning risk calculator is use to estimate the cost of installations in power systems and lightning applications.

            </p>
              <p> 4.To perform all the calculations manually and to arrive at the risk level might be a tedious task. You will need an expert to perform the task and you will have to invest both your time and money for the same. To make this task incredibly easy for you, we, at JEF, have come up with an automated tool to perform your RISK ASSESSMENT within seconds.</p>

         <h3 style="color:#479fe0;">HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION SHOWN IN THE REPORT IS CORRECT OR NOT?</h3>
         <p> To answer this question, you need to get a basic idea of how exactly the software functions and below points will help you in understanding that.</p>
         <img src="../assets/images/blog/chart.jpg" alt=""/>
         <p><b>1. Lightning Hazard Evaluation </b>- This is the first step to evaluate the severity of lightning. The severity of lightning differs from region to region, but it is not sufficient to consider the frequency of cloud-to-ground lightning of the area. Other factors such as Building Dimensions, Risk of Fire, Fire protection measures, Number of Functional Hours, Type of Building, Total number of People in the structure and so on should be considered. These factors basically form the “INPUT DATA” for your building/structure.<br>

             <b>2. Lightning Risk Assessment </b>- This is a process to assess the lightning risk from the loss of damage caused by lightning and its occurrence frequency under a given lightning hazard. The risk R is defined as the product of occurrence frequency of damage caused by lightning and loss by the damage.<br>

            <b>3. Lightning Risk Management </b>- This is a process to determine the best risk management policy considering the lightning risk, the loss of the damage and cost of protection.<br>

            <b>4. Designing of Lightning Protection System</b> - We have developed a novel lightning risk assessment & Design Tool, using this tool, we can evaluate lightning hazard level and lightning risk based on the lightning data, facility data and topographical data.<br>

            <b>5. Bill Of Materials</b>- This is the final step wherein automated bill of materials with the consolidated cost will be generated. This can be used as tentative cost estimation for tendering and budgetary purposes.<br>
