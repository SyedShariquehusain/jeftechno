              <h2>Electrical Fire in Covid-19 Hospitals A Preventable Emergency</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="post-media"> <img src="../assets/images/blog/ef1.png" alt=""><span class="event-calender blog-date"> 21 <span>june</span> </span> </div>
            <div class="post-entry">
              <p> Power Systems in hospital facilities are particularly vulnerable given the sudden increase in nonlinear electronic loads comprising of ventilators, diagnostic imaging equipment, Patient monitors and many bio medical devices – a crucial defense aid in fighting COVID. With improper electrical systems, further marred by non-compliance to electrical standards and poor workmanship, hospitals are staring at the high risk of overheating their electrical installation that could provoke fire. </p>
              <p>Fire Causes: <br>
                  Faulty electrical outlets and old, outdated equipment are the leading causes of electrical fires.Never use a device with a broken or damaged cable because it can cause a fire by sending heat to flammable surfaces including floors, drapes, and carpets. 
              </p>
              <p>Fire prevention: <br>
                  Around a socket, light switch, or light fixture, there may be burn marks or discoloration. When you touch an appliance, an outlet, or a power wire, it feels warm. When an object is plugged in or in operation, it emits a burning odor. When you plug in a gadget, electrical sparks appear. Each time you plug in a gadget, you get an electric jolt.
              </p>
              <h3 style="color:#479fe0;">REASON:Electrical fires causes and prevention</h3>
              <p><b>Poor electrical wiring and cabling</b><br>
             Power-hungry electrical equipment such as MRI, CT Scans, and X-Ray machines, Ventilators and other medical devices, used in hospitals need uninterrupted power supply. A durable cable network is thus absolutely essential to carry this power supply without overheating.</p>
             <p><b>Faulty electrical installations in an oxygen-rich environment</b><br>
                Areas such as operation theaters and ICUs have a high concentration of oxygen. Any electrical short circuit in these areas, could lead to electrical shock to surgeons or patients. In order to achieve uninterrupted power, or for surge control, UPS systems are used which are supported by batteries.

                                                                                                                                            </p>
             
                <!-- <p> 2.Assessing the risk caused by lightning is a complex process because the likelihood that your facility will be facing a lightning strike depends on several factors. </p> -->
             
            <p><b>Use of batteries</b><br>
                <!-- In many cases, these batteries are installed in close proximity to the Medical equipment. These batteries often release harmful and flammable gases which adds to the threat of fire accidents. Hence, it is important to provide special attention to electrical wiring, earthing and switchboard installation.</p>                                                                                                                               <p> 3.And we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives, historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures and what not!! There is a high possibility that the electrical/electronic equipment inside these buildings/structures might also be at risk. The only way to find that out is, to do a RISK ASSESSMENT for your building/structure!</p> -->
             
                <p><b>Increased use of flammable alcohol-based sanitizers</b><br>
                With the addition of Ventilators, air-conditioners, high-capacity machines in the ICUs, testing facilities for COVID, the addition of more rooms, and increased use of flammable alcohol-based sanitizers or PPE kits, risks of fire are only going higher. Add to it the poorly designed power systems built with even poorer workmanship, it all works like oxygen to start an electrical fire and feed it further.</p>
                <h3 style="color:#479fe0;">SOLUTION- BUILDING A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO FIRE SAFETY</h3>
               <p><b>Ensure compliance to building codes for safety and reliability</b><br>
                Fire in Covid-19 Hospitals - Prevention must be the goal Hospitals that use several non-linear loads and sensitive electronics alongside heavy-duty air conditioners and heaters, other large or small medical testing instruments, and are therefore always at the risk of poor power quality. While the first responsibility to ensure compliance to building codes for safety and reliability rests with designers.</p>
                <h5 style="color:#479fe0;">Electrical & Fire Safety Audit</h3><br>
               <p> Proper maintenance and monitoring of Power Quality on an ongoing basis is important. With rising number of electrical fires in hospitals, several state and regulatory agencies have ordered a fire audit of the facilities. While a proactive fire audit of the COVID hospitals is a welcome move, the fire audits are testing the ability of the facility to protect itself from the fire, if it were to occur, not prevent the fire.</p>
               <p><b>Wire your electrical networks right</b><br>
                    Poor quality cables could lead to a serious fire incident at a hospital. It is vital that attention be paid to the wiring in the entire health facility. The global norm is to use ‘Low Smoke and Zero Halogen (LSOH) wiring. However, in India, Flame Retardant Low Smoke (FRLS) wires are used widely. Reports suggest that these wires may not necessarily help avoid fire incidents completely.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
                
                <p><b>The ventilation system</b><br>
                    The ventilation system in a hospital also has a role to play in this scenario. If the hospital is air-conditioned, an efficient mechanical ventilation system must be installed to avoid electrical fires from spreading</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <!-- <p> 4.To perform all the calculations manually and to arrive at the risk level might be a tedious task. You will need an expert to perform the task and you will have to invest both your time and money for the same. To make this task incredibly easy for you, we, at JEF, have come up with an automated tool to perform your RISK ASSESSMENT within seconds.</p> -->
              <h5 style="color:#479fe0;">Pay attention to earthing</h5>
                     <p>A common practice in the Indian setup is to use separate earthing connections for all the electronic medical or non-medical equipment, but it is unjustified.
                    </p>
                        All conductive metal in an equipotential area should be connected to a common equipotential earthing point with a special heavy-duty cable. This reduces the possibility of leakage currents that can cause micro electrocution when the surgeon or patient comes into contact with the equipment.

                                                                                                                                                                    </p>
                    <h5 style="color:#479fe0;" >Ensuring good Power Quality to prevent electrical fire</h5>
                            <p>There are several tools to proactively identify the vulnerabilities in power systems, including power quality issues, much before they lead to extreme events of electrical fire.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                    <!-- <blockquote class="dark-bg"> We're not leaving here without Buster, man. Leave no crash-test dummy behind nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere! </blockquote> -->
             <p>Thermal Imaging is highly helpful in understanding the potential overheating in the electrical network. Periodic measurements and monitoring of harmonic distortion helps in early identification and prevention of heating in the electrical cables.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                    <!-- <p style="color:blue"; class="lead"><b> JEF SHIELD- LIGHTNING PROTECTION RISK ASSESSMENT, CONCEPT DESIGN DRAWINGS & BILL OF MATERIALS TOOL</b> </p> -->

         <img src="../assets/images/blog/chart.jpg" alt=""/>
         <p><b>1. Lightning Hazard Evaluation </b>- This is the first step to evaluate the severity of lightning. The severity of lightning differs from region to region, but it is not sufficient to consider the frequency of cloud-to-ground lightning of the area. Other factors such as Building Dimensions, Risk of Fire, Fire protection measures, Number of Functional Hours, Type of Building, Total number of People in the structure and so on should be considered. These factors basically form the “INPUT DATA” for your building/structure.<br>

             <b>2. Lightning Risk Assessment </b>- This is a process to assess the lightning risk from the loss of damage caused by lightning and its occurrence frequency under a given lightning hazard. The risk R is defined as the product of occurrence frequency of damage caused by lightning and loss by the damage.<br>

            <b>3. Lightning Risk Management </b>- This is a process to determine the best risk management policy considering the lightning risk, the loss of the damage and cost of protection.<br>

            <b>4. Designing of Lightning Protection System</b> - We have developed a novel lightning risk assessment & Design Tool, using this tool, we can evaluate lightning hazard level and lightning risk based on the lightning data, facility data and topographical data.<br>

            <b>5. Bill Of Materials</b>- This is the final step wherein automated bill of materials with the consolidated cost will be generated. This can be used as tentative cost estimation for tendering and budgetary purposes.<br>
