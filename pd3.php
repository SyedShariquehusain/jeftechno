In recent times, with the rapid growth of industries and commercial space, we are witnessing an exponential increase in the number of electrical accidents. The accidents not only cause loss of business but also cause a loss of life, brand image, business continuity and down the morale among the employees in the workplace.It is high time to have an Electrical Safety Audit at regular intervals to check the status of electrical systems.
							</p>
