			<h3 style="color:blue;">3.1 TERMS & DEFINITIONS :</h3>
			 <h3 style="color:blue;">3.1.17: TEMPORARY OVER VOLTAGE (TOV)- UT - TEST VALUE:</h3>
			<p>Test voltage applied to the SPD for a specific duration tT, to “simulate the stress” under TOV conditions.</p>
			<h3 style="color:blue;">TOV IS EXPECTED UNDER FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:</h3>
			<p>1) TOV caused by faults in HV & MV system (Clause 8.3.8.2)<br>

				2) TOV caused by faults in LV system (Clause 8.3.8.1)<br>

				3) TOV caused due to “Loss of Neutral” (Clause 8.3.8.1)

</p>
			<h3 style="color:blue;">UREF IS 255 V FOR TN-S SYSTEM</h3>
			<p>(ref: IS/IEC 61643-11, Ann. A,Table A.1- Reference test voltage values, 2nd page)<br>

				Voltage for L-N, 5s withstand in above table is : minimum 337 V<br>

				Voltage for L-N, 120 m -acceptable withstand or safe failure in above table is: minimum 440 V<br>

				TOV values are not applicable for N-PE & L-L for all systems (TN,TT & IT)</p>
				<h3 style="color:blue;">LEPS MODELS HAVE FOLLOWING TOV VALUES, FULLY COMPLYING TO IS/IEC 61643-11, AS PER ABOVE TABLE.<br>
					MODEL DMD3-65MAG , DMD3-50MAG & DMD3-30MAG:<br>
					TOV characteristics :</h3>
			<p>340 V (L-N, 5s-withstand)<br>

				440 V (120 minutes, safe failure)<br>

				Hence, LEPS SPDs for power line applications (main DB, Sub DB etc) fully satisfies TOV test values in compliance with IS/IEC 61643-11.</p>
					<!-- <p>Lightning is the most natural phenomenon occurring in nature. All of us encounter lightning very often. Especially if the location is more prone to thunderstorm, lightning is quite obvious! .</p>
             <p>And we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives,historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures and what not!! There is a high possibility that the electrical/electronic equipment inside these buildings/structures might also be at risk. The only way to find that out is, to do to a RISK ASSESSMENT for your building/structure!</p>
			<p>If you want to manually calculate your risk for any particular building/structure, then you have to follow all the steps and formulae given in IS/IEC 62305-2. This particular part exclusively talks about performing lightning risk assessment for any application of your choice. Be it your house, office, mall, industry etc.</p>
			<p>To perform all the calculations manually and to arrive at the risk level might be a tedious task. You will need an expert to perform the task. You will have to invest both your time and money for the same. To make this task incredibly easy for you, we, at JEF, has come up with a software to perform your RISK ASSESSMENT! This is an automated software which is built based on the formulae given in IS/IEC 62305-2. The MOST EXCITING thing about our software is you can perform the entire risk assessment and even generate the “Bill of Materials” & “Report” within 5 minutes!! Isn’t that brilliantly awesome?!</p>
			<p>The major advantage of our software is, it performs both internal & external risk assessment parallelly and does the iterative process of carrying out the risk assessment from level 4 to level 1 and gives a best techno-commercial solution. This parallel risk assessment of arriving whether a building/structure requires a level 4 Lightning Protection Systems (LPS) with level 4 Surge Protection Device (SPD) or any other level of protection can be determined only in the software. It is not possible when you are performing risk assessment manually. Software even avoids the human error which may occur when you are calculating the risk manually. The cost implication which might occur from level 4 to level 1 is shown in the below graph. Level 4 being the least level of protection and level 1 being the highest level of protection. The cost increases almost 4 times from level 4 to level 1.</p>

			<p>Now, you might probably have a few questions to ask!! Hold on, I’m sure you are going to find all your answers in the next 2 minutes, so continue reading!
				I’m guessing your first question would be, what is the name of the software and where do I find it? Well, we call this software as JEF SHIELD. The working principle behind JEF SHIELD is, it identifies the risk, does the analysis and finally evaluates your RISK LEVEL.</p>
			<p><b>And it can found on www.jeftechno.com!</b><br>And the next obvious and a million dollar question , how do I use this software? Do not worry, our software is very much user friendly. All you have to do is give ACCURATE input data as and when it asks. So to give accurate data, you will have to do your homework thoroughly. Your risk assessment results are solely dependent on your INPUT DATA. More the accuracy of your input data, more the accuracy of your risk level! You can say, they are directly proportional to each other. .</p>
			<p>Going to the next question which you would have, what exactly is this “INPUT DATA” ? Input Data includes around 20-25<br> crucial parameters which mainly includes :<br>

       		A. Location in which the building/structure is presentd<br>

			B. Length, Width & Height of the building/structure<br>

			C. Details of power & telecom lines<br>

			D. Type of floor, number of floors in the building/structure<br>

			E. Risk of fire<br>

			F. Total number of people in the building/structure & functional hours etc.

</p>	
			<p>Once the input data is given, our JEF SHIELD performs the risk assessment in the back-end. You can generate the risk assessment report and bill of materials within 2 minutes and download the same for your reference. .

					</p>
			<h3>ISN’T THAT SO COOL? BOTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY IS SAVED BIG TIME! .</h3>
			<p>If you are smart enough and have some basic knowledge about the building/ structure for which you are performing risk<br> assessment, then you are good to go!<br>

			Sitting in any corner of the world, you can perform risk assessment for any structure/building and have the results within<br> minutes!!<br>
			So, next time you have any requirement to perform lightning risk assessment for any kind of buildings/structures,<br><b> REMEMBER OUR JEF SHIELD!</b><br>

				Just one Google search away, quick , easy , user friendly and gives you accurate results within minutes!!</p>

				<!-- <p style="font-size:25px;" style="color:blue;">REASON</P>
              <p><b>Poor electrical wiring and cabling</b><br>
             Power-hungry electrical equipment such as MRI, CT Scans, and X-Ray machines, Ventilators and other medical devices, used in hospitals need uninterrupted power supply. A durable cable network is thus absolutely essential to carry this power supply without overheating.</p>
             <p><b>Faulty electrical installations in an oxygen-rich environment</b><br>
                Areas such as operation theaters and ICUs have a high concentration of oxygen. Any electrical short circuit in these areas, could lead to electrical shock to surgeons or patients. In order to achieve uninterrupted power, or for surge control, UPS systems are used which are supported by batteries.

                                                                                                                                            </p>
             
                <!-<p> 2.Assessing the risk caused by lightning is a complex process because the likelihood that your facility will be facing a lightning strike depends on several factors. </p> -->
             
            <!-- <p><b>Use of batteries</b><br>
                <! In many cases, these batteries are installed in close proximity to the Medical equipment. These batteries often release harmful and flammable gases which adds to the threat of fire accidents. Hence, it is important to provide special attention to electrical wiring, earthing and switchboard installation.</p>                                                                                                                               <p> 3.And we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives, historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures and what not!!

                <!-- With the addition of Ventilators, air-conditioners, high-capacity machines in the ICUs, testing facilities for COVID, the addition of more rooms, and increased use of flammable alcohol-based sanitizers or PPE kits, risks of fire are only going higher. Add to it the poorly designed power systems built with even poorer workmanship, it all works like oxygen to start an electrical fire and feed it further.</p> -->

                <!-- Fire in Covid-19 Hospitals - Prevention must be the goal Hospitals that use several non-linear loads and sensitive electronics alongside heavy-duty air conditioners and heaters, other large or small medical testing instruments, and are therefore always at the risk of poor power quality. While the first responsibility to ensure compliance to building codes for safety and reliability rests with designers.</p> -->
                <!-- <p><b>Electrical & Fire Safety Audit</b><br> -->
                <!-- Proper maintenance and monitoring of Power Quality on an ongoing basis is important. With rising number of electrical fires in hospitals, several state and regulatory agencies have ordered a fire audit of the facilities. While a proactive fire audit of the COVID hospitals is a welcome move, the fire audits are testing the ability of the facility to protect itself from the fire, if it were to occur, not prevent the fire.</p> -->
               <!-- <p><b>Wire your electrical networks right</b><br> -->
                    <!-- Poor quality cables could lead to a serious fire incident at a hospital. It is vital that attention be paid to the wiring in the entire health facility. The global norm is to use ‘Low Smoke and Zero Halogen (LSOH) wiring. However, in India, Flame Retardant Low Smoke (FRLS) wires are used widely. Reports suggest that these wires may not necessarily help avoid fire incidents completely. -->
