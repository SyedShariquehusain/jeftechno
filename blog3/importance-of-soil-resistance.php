            <h4>IMPORTANCE OF SOIL RESISTIVITY IN THE DESIGN OF EARTHING FOR THE SAFETY & RELIABILITY</h4>
            <p>Soil resistivity is a measurement of the resistance or electric current that the soil conducts.The design of a system based on passing current across the surface of the earth is a key component.</p>
            <p>Soil resistivity plays a vital role in the design of an earthing system. For substations, the key design acceptance (safety) criteria of touch and step potentials soil resistivity are greatly influenced. For other<a style="color:#479fe0;"  href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-systems.php">grounding systems</a> such as industrial plants / commercial and residential buildings, the acceptance criteria of overall grounding resistance and current density on the electrode surface are also dependent on soil resistivity. Hence, the accuracy of the design depends on the accuracy of the measured Soil resistivity values.</p>
            <p> As per standards, the soil conditions up to 3 to 4 times the longest dimension of the mat affect the current dissipation. The soil generally is not uniform all through the depth & breadth and varies with topography.</p>
            <p> Soil resistivity can be measured in a variety of methods. Electrical profiling is the best approach for assessing<a style="color:#479fe0;"  href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/soil-treatment-for-good-earthing.php"> soil resistivity for the design of earthing and safety requirements.</a> By injecting a current, and monitoring the voltage drop at different spacing, without any excavation electrical profile of the soil can be done. Wenner's Four-Point Method is the most popular and user-friendly method.</p>
            <p>In Wenner Four point method the resistivity is measured by using four spikes with equal spacing connected to the soil resistivity meter. The extreme spikes are called as current spikes and the inner spikes are called as potential spikes. The current will be injected through the extreme spikes. There will be a potential gradient in the mean area and the drop in the potential is measured between the potential spikes. The meter will display the resistance which can be used for the interpretation of resistivity of the soil by the established formula.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/imp-picture-1-1.png" alt=""/>
            <p>As the variation of depth is invariant with the spacing, the simplified form of the above formula would be</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/imp-picture-1-2.png" alt=""/>
            <p>Further, the resistivity of the soil cannot stay uniform all throughout the life as the soil can be eroded due to wind, rain, floods, manmade actions (excavations) etc. So the<a style="color:#479fe0;" href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/interconnection-of-earth-pits.php"> earth pit</a> resistance cannot be compared with the measured resistivity during the design /construction phase and the evaluation should be done by measuring the resistivity of the soil along with the measurement of the earth pit resistance at the time of acceptance testing.</p>
            <p>The resistivity of the soil normally varies for the different layers. As we go deeper, the resistivity of the soil may not vary much seasonally / changes in environmental conditions. Hence, the variation in resistivity of the top layers needs to be considered for earthing design.</p>
            <p>The resistivity of the soil is dependent on salt content, moisture and temperature and varies as per the graph below.</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/blog/imp-picture-3.png" alt=""/>
            <p>Parameters impacting the soil resistivity measurement<br>
                Soil resistivity measurement should be carried by using a quality meter which complies with the international standards and as per IEEE 81 Annex E. The measurement is to be carried by a meter which is having a capability of injecting the current at variable frequency and with variable voltage. The readings measured with low quality meters will not show accurate readings. Factors affecting measurement are:</p>
            <p>- Presence of loose/backfilled soil<br>
                - Presence of any buried metals like water, gas, other process pipelines and cables.<br>
                - Presence of live HT lines above the test setup may have an induced current in the cables connecting the spikes and may result in errors in measurement and also potential hazard to the personnel working on the test setup.<br>
                - Presence of water table near the measurement area or presence of any earth gird of a substation will have an impact on the measured values.<br>
                - To obtain accurate measurement, the distance of any such earth grids and water table from the soil resistivity measurement area should be at least the spacing between the spikes.</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/blog/imp-picture-4.png" alt=""/><br>
                <img src="../assets/images/blog/imp-picture-5.png" alt=""/>
                <p>Soil resistivity cannot be considered based on the average of values for the varying depths.</p>
                <p>Readings should be measured at different depths in a given direction and compared with the previous reading of the same direction to check the extent of variation. If there are any abnormal variations in the readings, the measurements may be repeated / additional measurements done for the intermediate depths. Typically, the largest variation in a given direction should be less than 30% for the soil to be considered as uniform.</p>
                <p>If variation is beyond this limit (which is true in most cases), the soil is deemed to be non uniform and multilayer soil model shall be used for designing. The number of layers will depend on the measured values and the criteria shall be to have as close match as possible with the measured values (As low an RMS error as possible).</p>
                <p>While using a simple average (arithmetic mean) of measured soil resistivity values for design, the margin of error in safety parameters due to soil resistivity can easily exceed 100%.</p>
                <p>The standards have provided formulas to determine approximate values of touch and step potentials for uniform layer and two layer soils and for multi-layer soil it is necessary to go in for software simulation models as prescribed in the IEEE 80 Annex H. The CDEGS software by SES has multi layer modelling capability and provides accurate and optimum design with least possible error.</p>
                <p>Measurement of resistivity at a location should be done depending on the function / purpose of the proposed earthing system. If standard earth pit of 3mtrs are to be installed (normal industrial plants, commercial / residential buildings), then the soil resistivity of upto a depth of 10mtrs is required. For a substation grid, the resistivity to a depth not less than the length of diagonal of the grid should be measured.</p>
                <p>Hence, an accurate measurement of soil resistivity is important in ensuring an optimum grounding design.</p>

            <!-- <p>Earthing is always the first line of defense when it comes to electrical safety. It is understood and accepted that a reliable Earthing system is required for the safety of humans and equipment’s which are connected to / come in contact with an electrical system.</p> --> 
            
                <!-- <p>In the recent article, we read about the sources of surges in Industrial & Commercial Power Systems. In this article, we will analyse solutions to protect the electronic equipment from surges. Nowadays, many electronic equipment failures are mainly due to two main reasons mentioned below.</p> -->
            
           <!-- <p>As the technology develops, standards are revised or superseded to take into account the advancement (or complexities in the electronic boards) and precautions to be added to minimise the risk with in tolerable levels. Lightning protection system is no exception to this. <b>Erstwhile IS 2309 was superseded by IS/IEC 62305</b> which is a comprehensive standard so that, not only structures and people are protected but also the electronics inside the structure. Because of this change, <b>NBC- National Building Code & CEA- Central Electricity Authority regulations</b> were also revised to adopt the recommendations given in IS/IEC 62305. Risk analysis of the building that needs protection is covered in detail, and this being a specialised activity, it has to be carried out by experts who are aware of the developments so that customers have their investment, well protected. Hence, it is mandatory to conduct an audit, collect data for risk assessment and implement the recommendations of risk assessment so that People, structure and all electronics inside the structure are well protected and within the tolerable levels.</p> -->

            <!-- <h3 style="color:blue;">METHODOLOGY OF LPS ADEQUACY STUDY:</h3>
            <p> Ascertain whether lightning protection system is provided for all the structures in the facility & if so provided, to which Indian/international standard they conform to.<br>
                If they conform to IS 2309 or NFC 17-102, then they are invalid, as highlighted in NBC 2016 and hence risk analysis to be done as per IS/IEC 62305 and recommendations to be implemented to bring the loss of human life and loss of economics under the tolerable levels.<br>
                To reduce the losses due to lightning, protection measures MAY BE required. Whether they are needed & to what extent, should be determined by the Risk Assessment (IS/IEC 62305- 2)</p>

            <p>Protection techniques that can be implement includes either standalone techniques or in combination of different techniques:</p>
            <p> Lightning protection as per LPL 1 to 4<br>
                Co-ordinated SPD protection<br>
                Fire protection (manual or automatic)<br>
                Soil equi-potentialization/ Earthing<br>
                Equi-potential bonding, shielding & routing.</p>    -->
            <!-- <p>Electricity has become an integral part of our everyday life. During power outages, we understand the importance of electricity within a few minutes. In recent times, with the rapid growth of industries and commercial space, we are witnessing an exponential increase in the number of electrical accidents. Such accidents not only cause loss of business but also cause loss of life, brand image, business continuity and loss of confidence amongst the employees in the workplace.</p>
            <p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) estimates that 10% of the fires occurring in manufacturing units and industries are related to electrical system failures, such as failure of electrical insulation, terminals, and related components.</p> 
            <h3 style="color:blue;">WHAT IS THERMOGRAPHY?</h3>
            <p>Thermography is a non destructive test method which is used as predictive maintenance fault finding technique in electrical equipments and helps in identifying potential electrical safety hazards and fire accidents.The technique inspects electrical equipments by obtaining heat distribution pictures and is based on the fact that most components in a system show an increase in temperature when malfunctioning. It helps in detecting hot spots, poor connections, unbalanced loads, deteriorated insulation, or other potential problems in energized electrical components. It allows to immediately see what's wrong in an electrical system. Timely detection of electrical problems helps to avoid fires caused by overloaded circuits or faulty wiring.</p>
            <h3 style="color:blue;">PURPOSE OF THERMOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>Faults in electrical systems are highlighted by hot spots. Hot spots are often the result of increased resistance in a circuit, overloading or insulation failure. Thermography helps in getting results without interrupting operational system.</p>
            <p>Electrical breakdowns are inconvenient and costly. Nowadays, maximizing uptime and maintaining the assets is a primary requisite for complex and sophisticated process systems. Even a short term production loss or breakdown could result in business loss. Thermography helps to identify the fault before a breakdown occurs. This gives us the opportunity to solve the problem as part of planned maintenance before it becomes a serious issue.</p>
            <p>Thermography is an investment in maintaining safety, productivity and profitability of any business. Value Addition<br><br>

         <img src="../assets/images/blog/chart.jpg" alt=""/>
         <p><b>1. Lightning Hazard Evaluation </b>- This is the first step to evaluate the severity of lightning. The severity of lightning differs from region to region, but it is not sufficient to consider the frequency of cloud-to-ground lightning of the area. Other factors such as Building Dimensions, Risk of Fire, Fire protection measures, Number of Functional Hours, Type of Building, Total number of People in the structure and so on should be considered. These factors basically form the “INPUT DATA” for your building/structure.<br>

             <b>2. Lightning Risk Assessment </b>- This is a process to assess the lightning risk from the loss of damage caused by lightning and its occurrence frequency under a given lightning hazard. The risk R is defined as the product of occurrence frequency of damage caused by lightning and loss by the damage.<br>

            <b>3. Lightning Risk Management </b>- This is a process to determine the best risk management policy considering the lightning risk, the loss of the damage and cost of protection.<br>

            <b>4. Designing of Lightning Protection System</b> - We have developed a novel lightning risk assessment & Design Tool, using this tool, we can evaluate lightning hazard level and lightning risk based on the lightning data, facility data and topographical data.<br>

            <b>5. Bill Of Materials</b>- This is the final step wherein automated bill of materials with the consolidated cost will be generated. This can be used as tentative cost estimation for tendering and budgetary purposes.<br>
